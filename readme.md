# Ultrasonic texture synthesis
## Comparison of different methods - projet inter-disciplinaire de FISE3 Télécom St-Etienne
In this repo we try to compare different methods of ultrasonic texture synthesis. We tested Method Efros-Leung(Pixel copy), Method Optim, Method Image-Quilting and Method DeepTexture.
</br>
The comparison metrics we choose are GIST feature, LBP feature(circular rotation invariant LBP) and SSIM feature.
